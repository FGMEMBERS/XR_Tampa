Hi,

We would like to thank you for downloading our XR-Tampa.  This is without a doubt a project for motorists. 

XR-Tampa (XR_Tampa) is licensed under GPL.

Please visit our website or Github and download our add-on folder (Version 2016.2.0 or newer), which includes sound files and pushback model.

If you believe that our plane has an error, you should inform us by visiting our website.  

We hope you enjoy our vehicle and we are looking forward to seeing snapshots and videos of your journey in the FG forum, Youtube and social media sites.

Best regards,

Aucafly Team
